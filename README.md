## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and Open Props integration using JIT package
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Astro
- Svelte for Mobile Main Menu
- CUBE methodology for CSS implementation


### What I learned

There are interesting use cases to apply different HTML/CSS techniques in this challenge.
One of those is the use of the <picture> element with <source> ones, in order to specify different images for mobile and desktop versions for the gallery section. Responsive, art-directed images implementation is much easier with those elements.
